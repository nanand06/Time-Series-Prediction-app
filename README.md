# Time-Series-Prediction-app(BETA-VERSION)

This is an All-inclusive tool that can be used by individuals with statistics knowledge to Train/Test/Tune statistical models. This tool is currently integrated with Kaggle's Formula One dataset, so the user can use this tool to perform analysis of future predictions on F1 Data

How to Use: 

1) Install required dependencies if not installed: Pyqt5, statsmodels, matplotlib, pandas, pytorch

2) Run the F1.py file. After this, the Pyqt5 interface should successfully pop-up

More features will be added very soon as this project is in the BETA stage.
